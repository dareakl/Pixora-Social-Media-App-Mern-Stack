Node JS Interview Questions


1. Core Node.js Concepts
Event Loop and Non-Blocking I/O

Theory Question: What is the event loop in Node.js, and how does it handle asynchronous I/O?

Explanation: The event loop is the heart of Node.js. It handles non-blocking I/O operations by allowing Node.js to perform asynchronous operations, such as reading files, making HTTP requests, etc. The event loop allows the program to continue execution while these operations are happening in the background.

Code Example:
const fs = require('fs');
console.log("Start reading file");

fs.readFile('example.txt', 'utf8', (err, data) => {
    if (err) throw err;
    console.log(data);
});

console.log("End reading file");

In this example, fs.readFile is non-blocking, so "End reading file" will be printed before the file's content.

Callback Hell / Promise / Async-Await

Theory Question: What is callback hell, and how can you avoid it using Promises or async/await?

Explanation: Callback hell happens when you have multiple nested callbacks, making code difficult to read and maintain. You can avoid it by using Promises and async/await.

Code Example (Callback Hell):

fs.readFile('file1.txt', (err, data1) => {
    if (err) throw err;
    fs.readFile('file2.txt', (err, data2) => {
        if (err) throw err;
        console.log(data1 + data2);
    });
});

Code Example (Using Promises):
const readFile = (fileName) => {
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        fs.readFile(fileName, 'utf8', (err, data) => {
            if (err) reject(err);
            resolve(data);
        });
    });
};

readFile('file1.txt')
    .then((data1) => readFile('file2.txt'))
    .then((data2) => console.log(data1 + data2))
    .catch((err) => console.log(err));

Event Emitters

Theory Question: What are event emitters in Node.js? How do they work?

Explanation: Event emitters are objects that allow handling and firing events. The EventEmitter class in Node.js is used to create custom event handling mechanisms.

Code Example:
const EventEmitter = require('events');
class MyEmitter extends EventEmitter {}

const myEmitter = new MyEmitter();
myEmitter.on('event', () => {
    console.log('An event has occurred!');
});

myEmitter.emit('event');  // Output: An event has occurred!

2. Working with Node.js Modules
Theory Question: What is the role of require in Node.js? How do you create your own module?

Explanation: require is used to load modules. Node.js provides core modules like http, fs, etc. You can also create custom modules using module.exports.

Code Example:
// myModule.js
module.exports = {
    greet: function(name) {
        return `Hello, ${name}`;
    }
};

// app.js
const myModule = require('./myModule');
console.log(myModule.greet('World'));  // Output: Hello, World

3. Express.js Framework
Theory Question: What is Express.js? How does it simplify routing and middleware?

Explanation: Express.js is a minimal web framework built on top of Node.js that simplifies the creation of web servers, routing, and middleware management.

Code Example:
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

// Middleware
app.use(express.json());

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
    res.send('Hello, world!');
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
    console.log('Server is running on port 3000');
});


4. REST APIs and HTTP Requests
Theory Question: How do you make HTTP requests in Node.js? Explain using http and axios.

Explanation: You can use the built-in http module or third-party libraries like axios for making HTTP requests.

Code Example (Using HTTP Module):

const http = require('http');

http.get('http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts', (res) => {
    let data = '';
    res.on('data', (chunk) => {
        data += chunk;
    });

    res.on('end', () => {
        console.log(JSON.parse(data));
    });
});

Code Example (Using Axios):
const axios = require('axios');

axios.get('http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts')
    .then((response) => {
        console.log(response.data);
    })
    .catch((error) => {
        console.error(error);
    });


5. Database Interaction
Theory Question: How do you connect a Node.js application to a MongoDB database? What is Mongoose?

Explanation: Mongoose is an ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB and Node.js. It simplifies the interaction with MongoDB by providing a schema-based solution to model your data.

Code Example (Using Mongoose):
const mongoose = require('mongoose');
mongoose.connect('mongodb://localhost/test', { useNewUrlParser: true, useUnifiedTopology: true })
    .then(() => console.log('Connected to MongoDB'))
    .catch((err) => console.error('Connection error', err));

const Schema = mongoose.Schema;
const userSchema = new Schema({
    name: String,
    email: String
});

const User = mongoose.model('User', userSchema);

6. Error Handling
Theory Question: How do you handle errors in Node.js?

Explanation: Error handling in Node.js can be done using try/catch, callback functions, and Promise rejection handlers. It's important to handle asynchronous errors appropriately using .catch() for Promises or try/catch for async/await.

Code Example (Promise Error Handling):
const readFile = (fileName) => {
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        fs.readFile(fileName, 'utf8', (err, data) => {
            if (err) reject(err);
            resolve(data);
        });
    });
};

readFile('file.txt')
    .then((data) => console.log(data))
    .catch((err) => console.log('Error:', err));

7. Performance Optimization
Theory Question: How can you optimize the performance of a Node.js application?

Explanation: Performance optimization in Node.js includes:

Using asynchronous programming to avoid blocking the event loop.

Clustering to take advantage of multi-core systems.

Using caching mechanisms.

Optimizing database queries and minimizing unnecessary computations.

8. Testing in Node.js
Theory Question: How do you write tests in Node.js? What testing frameworks are used?

Explanation: You can use testing frameworks like Mocha, Chai, and Jest to write unit and integration tests.

Code Example (Using Mocha and Chai):
const assert = require('chai').assert;
describe('Array', function() {
    it('should return -1 when the value is not present', function() {
        assert.equal([1, 2, 3].indexOf(4), -1);
    });
});

9. Security Considerations
Theory Question: What are some common security vulnerabilities in Node.js applications, and how can you mitigate them?

Explanation: Common vulnerabilities include SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), cross-site request forgery (CSRF), and improper authentication. Mitigation strategies include using prepared statements for database queries, escaping user inputs, using HTTPS, and securing API keys.

1. Handling Asynchronous Code in Node.js
In Node.js, most of the work is asynchronous, so knowing how to work with asynchronous functions is critical. Below are several key techniques to handle async code.

Callback Example (Basic)
This is a classic approach to asynchronous programming using callbacks.
const fs = require('fs');

fs.readFile('file.txt', 'utf8', (err, data) => {
    if (err) {
        console.error('Error reading file', err);
        return;
    }
    console.log('File content:', data);
});


Explanation: Here, fs.readFile reads a file asynchronously. The callback function is executed when the file reading completes. If there’s an error, it’s passed into the callback function.

Promise Example
Promises help avoid callback hell by providing .then() and .catch() methods for handling success and failure.

const fs = require('fs');

const readFileAsync = (fileName) => {
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        fs.readFile(fileName, 'utf8', (err, data) => {
            if (err) reject(err);
            else resolve(data);
        });
    });
};

readFileAsync('file.txt')
    .then((data) => console.log('File content:', data))
    .catch((err) => console.error('Error reading file', err));

Explanation: This refactor uses a Promise to wrap the fs.readFile function. resolve is called when the file is read successfully, and reject is called if there’s an error.

Async-Await Example
With async/await, asynchronous code can be written in a synchronous style, which makes it easier to read and maintain.

const fs = require('fs').promises;

const readFileAsync = async (fileName) => {
    try {
        const data = await fs.readFile(fileName, 'utf8');
        console.log('File content:', data);
    } catch (err) {
        console.error('Error reading file', err);
    }
};

readFileAsync('file.txt');

Explanation: async defines a function as asynchronous. await is used to wait for the Promise to resolve. If the Promise is rejected, it goes to the catch block.

2. Express.js Routing and Middleware
Express.js simplifies routing and middleware handling. Here are some practical examples for building a basic web server and API.

Simple Route Handling
Creating simple routes with Express.js.
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
    res.send('Hello, world!');
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
    console.log('Server running on port 3000');
});

Explanation: app.get() defines a route for GET requests to the root path (/). When a request is made, the server responds with "Hello, world!" on port 3000.

Middleware Example
Middleware functions are executed during the lifecycle of a request to the server. They are commonly used for logging, authentication, and error handling.
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

// Logging middleware
app.use((req, res, next) => {
    console.log(`${req.method} ${req.url}`);
    next();  // Pass control to the next handler
});

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
    res.send('Hello from Express!');
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
    console.log('Server running on port 3000');
});

Explanation: The middleware logs every incoming request’s method and URL. next() is called to pass control to the next middleware or route handler.

API with Express and JSON Response
A simple REST API that responds with JSON.
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.get('/api/users', (req, res) => {
    const users = [
        { id: 1, name: 'Alice' },
        { id: 2, name: 'Bob' }
    ];
    res.json(users);
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
    console.log('API running on port 3000');
});

Explanation: The /api/users route responds with a JSON array of users.

3. Database Operations Using Mongoose (MongoDB)
Mongoose is an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library that provides a powerful way to interact with MongoDB.

Connect to MongoDB and Define Schema
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

// Connect to MongoDB
mongoose.connect('mongodb://localhost/mydb', { useNewUrlParser: true, useUnifiedTopology: true })
    .then(() => console.log('Connected to MongoDB'))
    .catch((err) => console.error('Failed to connect to MongoDB', err));

// Define a user schema
const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
    name: String,
    email: { type: String, required: true, unique: true }
});

// Create a model based on the schema
const User = mongoose.model('User', userSchema);

// Create a new user
const createUser = async () => {
    const user = new User({ name: 'John Doe', email: 'john@example.com' });
    await user.save();
    console.log('User created:', user);
};

createUser();

Explanation: This code connects to a local MongoDB instance, defines a schema for User, and saves a new user to the database.

Querying Data from MongoDB
const getUserByEmail = async (email) => {
    const user = await User.findOne({ email });
    if (user) {
        console.log('User found:', user);
    } else {
        console.log('User not found');
    }
};

getUserByEmail('john@example.com');

Explanation: The findOne method is used to search for a single user by email. If the user is found, it is logged; otherwise, a message is shown.

4. Error Handling and Custom Error Classes
In Node.js, handling errors properly is key to building reliable applications.

Custom Error Class
class AppError extends Error {
    constructor(message, statusCode) {
        super(message);
        this.statusCode = statusCode;
        this.isOperational = true;
        Error.captureStackTrace(this, this.constructor);
    }
}

const throwError = () => {
    throw new AppError('Something went wrong!', 500);
};

try {
    throwError();
} catch (err) {
    console.error(`Error: ${err.message} with status code ${err.statusCode}`);
}

Explanation: A custom error class AppError is created, which includes a statusCode and isOperational flag. The captureStackTrace method captures the stack trace for better debugging.

5. Clustering for Multi-Core Performance
Node.js runs on a single thread by default. To utilize multi-core CPUs, you can use the cluster module.

Basic Clustering Example
const cluster = require('cluster');
const http = require('http');
const numCPUs = require('os').cpus().length;

if (cluster.isMaster) {
    // Fork workers for each CPU core
    for (let i = 0; i < numCPUs; i++) {
        cluster.fork();
    }

    cluster.on('exit', (worker, code, signal) => {
        console.log(`Worker ${worker.process.pid} died`);
    });
} else {
    // Worker processes have a server
    http.createServer((req, res) => {
        res.writeHead(200);
        res.end('Hello from Worker ' + process.pid);
    }).listen(8000);
}

Explanation: The master process forks a worker for each CPU core. Each worker handles incoming HTTP requests on port 8000. This allows the app to scale across multiple cores.

6. Performance Optimization: Caching with Redis
Caching can significantly improve performance by reducing the need to repeatedly query the database or external APIs.

Redis Caching Example
const redis = require('redis');
const client = redis.createClient();

client.on('connect', function() {
    console.log('Connected to Redis');
});

// Set a cache value
client.set('myKey', 'myValue', redis.print);

// Get a cache value
client.get('myKey', function(err, reply) {
    if (err) throw err;
    console.log(reply);  // Will log 'myValue'
});

Explanation: This example shows how to use Redis for caching. The client.set() method stores data in the cache, and client.get() retrieves it.

1. Asynchronous Programming: Handling Parallel Asynchronous Operations
Question: How can you handle multiple asynchronous operations concurrently in Node.js?
Solution:
You can use Promise.all() to handle multiple asynchronous operations in parallel.

const fs = require('fs').promises;

const readFileAsync = async (fileName) => {
    try {
        const data = await fs.readFile(fileName, 'utf8');
        return data;
    } catch (err) {
        throw err;
    }
};

const getAllFilesContent = async () => {
    try {
        const [file1Content, file2Content] = await Promise.all([
            readFileAsync('file1.txt'),
            readFileAsync('file2.txt')
        ]);
        console.log('File 1 Content:', file1Content);
        console.log('File 2 Content:', file2Content);
    } catch (err) {
        console.error('Error:', err);
    }
};

getAllFilesContent();


Explanation: Here, Promise.all() is used to read two files concurrently. It waits for both promises to resolve before logging the content.

2. Express.js: Handling Route Parameters
Question: How can you access route parameters in Express.js?
Solution:
You can use req.params to access route parameters.

const express = require('express');
const app = express();

// Define route with a route parameter ":id"
app.get('/user/:id', (req, res) => {
    const userId = req.params.id;
    res.send(`User ID is ${userId}`);
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
    console.log('Server is running on port 3000');
});


Explanation: In the route /user/:id, :id is a route parameter. You can access it via req.params.id inside the route handler.

3. Database: Mongoose Query - Update Document
Question: How do you update a document in MongoDB using Mongoose?
Solution:
You can use Model.updateOne() or Model.findOneAndUpdate() to update a document.

const mongoose = require('mongoose');

// Define a simple schema and model
const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
    name: String,
    email: String
});

const User = mongoose.model('User', userSchema);

// Update a user's email
const updateUserEmail = async (userId, newEmail) => {
    try {
        const result = await User.findOneAndUpdate(
            { _id: userId },
            { email: newEmail },
            { new: true }  // Returns the updated document
        );
        console.log('Updated User:', result);
    } catch (err) {
        console.error('Error updating user:', err);
    }
};

mongoose.connect('mongodb://localhost/mydb')
    .then(() => updateUserEmail('60f7b8d8f12f1c17c9f6b0a8', 'newemail@example.com'))
    .catch((err) => console.error('Database connection error:', err));


    Explanation: findOneAndUpdate() is used here to find a user by _id and update their email. The new: true option ensures that the updated document is returned.

4. Error Handling: Handling Asynchronous Errors in Node.js
Question: How do you handle asynchronous errors in Node.js?
Solution:
You should use try/catch blocks when working with async/await and .catch() for Promises.

const fs = require('fs').promises;

const readFileAsync = async (fileName) => {
    try {
        const data = await fs.readFile(fileName, 'utf8');
        return data;
    } catch (err) {
        throw new Error('File reading failed');
    }
};

const readFileContent = async () => {
    try {
        const content = await readFileAsync('nonexistent-file.txt');
        console.log(content);
    } catch (err) {
        console.error('Error:', err.message);
    }
};

readFileContent();

Explanation: In the readFileAsync() function, a try/catch block is used to catch any errors during file reading. The error is then handled in the catch block inside readFileContent().

5. Authentication: Creating a Simple Authentication Middleware
Question: How would you create a simple authentication middleware in Express.js?
Solution:
Here’s an example of middleware to check for a valid token (simplified for demonstration purposes):

const express = require('express');
const app = express();

// Sample middleware to authenticate API requests
const authenticate = (req, res, next) => {
    const token = req.headers['authorization'];

    if (!token) {
        return res.status(403).send('Access Denied: No token provided');
    }

    if (token === 'mysecrettoken') {
        next(); // Proceed to the next middleware or route handler
    } else {
        return res.status(403).send('Access Denied: Invalid token');
    }
};

// Protected route
app.get('/protected', authenticate, (req, res) => {
    res.send('Welcome to the protected route!');
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
    console.log('Server running on port 3000');
});


Explanation: The authenticate middleware checks the Authorization header for a token. If the token matches, the request proceeds; otherwise, a 403 status is returned.

6. Performance Optimization: Caching with Redis
Question: How would you implement caching in Node.js using Redis?
Solution:
Here’s how you can cache data in Redis to reduce database queries.

const redis = require('redis');
const client = redis.createClient();
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

// Simulate a database call
const getUserFromDatabase = (userId) => {
    return new Promise((resolve) => {
        setTimeout(() => resolve({ id: userId, name: 'John Doe' }), 1000);  // Simulating DB query
    });
};

// Cache middleware
const cacheUser = (req, res, next) => {
    const userId = req.params.id;
    
    client.get(userId, async (err, cachedUser) => {
        if (cachedUser) {
            return res.json(JSON.parse(cachedUser));  // Return cached user data
        } else {
            req.userId = userId;
            next();  // Proceed to the next route handler
        }
    });
};

// User route
app.get('/user/:id', cacheUser, async (req, res) => {
    const userId = req.userId;
    const user = await getUserFromDatabase(userId);
    
    client.setex(userId, 3600, JSON.stringify(user));  // Cache user for 1 hour
    res.json(user);
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
    console.log('Server running on port 3000');
});


Explanation: This example demonstrates caching with Redis. Before querying the database, it checks Redis for the cached user data. If cached data is available, it is returned immediately; otherwise, it queries the database and caches the result.

7. Unit Testing: Writing Unit Tests with Mocha and Chai
Question: How do you write unit tests for a function in Node.js?
Solution:
You can use Mocha and Chai for unit testing in Node.js.

// Function to test
const sum = (a, b) => a + b;

// Unit test using Mocha and Chai
const chai = require('chai');
const expect = chai.expect;

describe('sum', () => {
    it('should return the sum of two numbers', () => {
        const result = sum(2, 3);
        expect(result).to.equal(5);
    });

    it('should return a negative number when summing a negative and a positive number', () => {
        const result = sum(-2, 3);
        expect(result).to.equal(1);
    });
});


Explanation: This example tests the sum function using Mocha's describe and it blocks. Chai's expect syntax is used to assert that the function returns the correct values.

8. Handling File Uploads with Multer
Question: How would you handle file uploads in Node.js?
Solution:
You can use multer to handle file uploads in Express.js.

const express = require('express');
const multer = require('multer');
const app = express();

// Set up file storage
const storage = multer.diskStorage({
    destination: (req, file, cb) => {
        cb(null, 'uploads/');
    },
    filename: (req, file, cb) => {
        cb(null, Date.now() + '-' + file.originalname);
    }
});

const upload = multer({ storage });

// Route to handle file upload
app.post('/upload', upload.single('file'), (req, res) => {
    if (!req.file) {
        return res.status(400).send('No file uploaded');
    }
    res.send('File uploaded successfully: ' + req.file.filename);
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
    console.log('Server running on port 3000');
});


Explanation: The multer middleware is used to handle file uploads. The upload.single('file') middleware handles a single file upload, and the file is saved in the uploads/ directory.



1. Reverse a String
Question: Write a function to reverse a string.
Solution:

const reverseString = (str) => {
    return str.split('').reverse().join('');
};

// Example usage:
console.log(reverseString("hello"));  // Output: "olleh"


Explanation: This solution splits the string into an array of characters, reverses the array, and then joins it back into a string.

2. Check if a Number is Prime
Question: Write a function to check if a given number is prime.
Solution:
const isPrime = (num) => {
    if (num <= 1) return false;
    for (let i = 2; i <= Math.sqrt(num); i++) {
        if (num % i === 0) return false;
    }
    return true;
};

// Example usage:
console.log(isPrime(7));  // Output: true
console.log(isPrime(10)); // Output: false


Explanation: This solution iterates from 2 up to the square root of the number. If the number is divisible by any of these, it is not a prime. This reduces the time complexity from O(n) to O(√n).

3. Find the Missing Number in an Array
Question: Given an array containing n-1 distinct numbers taken from the range 1 to n, find the missing number.
Solution:
const findMissingNumber = (arr, n) => {
    const totalSum = (n * (n + 1)) / 2;  // Sum of first n natural numbers
    const arrSum = arr.reduce((acc, num) => acc + num, 0);
    return totalSum - arrSum;
};

// Example usage:
console.log(findMissingNumber([1, 2, 4, 6, 3, 7, 8], 8));  // Output: 5


Explanation: The total sum of numbers from 1 to n is calculated using the formula n * (n + 1) / 2. Then, the sum of the elements in the array is subtracted from the total sum to find the missing number.

4. Fibonacci Sequence
Question: Write a function that returns the nth Fibonacci number.
Solution (Recursive):
const fibonacci = (n) => {
    if (n <= 1) return n;
    return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2);
};

// Example usage:
console.log(fibonacci(5));  // Output: 5

Solution (Iterative):
const fibonacci = (n) => {
    let a = 0, b = 1;
    for (let i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
        let temp = a + b;
        a = b;
        b = temp;
    }
    return n > 0 ? b : a;
};

// Example usage:
console.log(fibonacci(5));  // Output: 5


Explanation: The recursive solution calls the function repeatedly for n-1 and n-2. The iterative approach is more efficient, with a time complexity of O(n) and constant space usage.

5. Find Duplicate in an Array
Question: Write a function to find the first duplicate number in an array.
Solution:
const findDuplicate = (arr) => {
    const seen = new Set();
    for (let num of arr) {
        if (seen.has(num)) {
            return num;  // First duplicate
        }
        seen.add(num);
    }
    return null;  // No duplicates
};

// Example usage:
console.log(findDuplicate([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 3]));  // Output: 3

Explanation: The function iterates over the array, adding elements to a Set. If an element is already in the Set, it means it's a duplicate and is returned.

6. Flatten an Array
Question: Write a function to flatten a nested array into a single array.
Solution:
const flattenArray = (arr) => {
    return arr.reduce((flat, current) => {
        return flat.concat(Array.isArray(current) ? flattenArray(current) : current);
    }, []);
};

// Example usage:
console.log(flattenArray([1, [2, [3, 4], 5], 6]));  // Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

Explanation: The reduce() method is used to recursively flatten the array. If an element is an array, the function calls itself, otherwise it adds the element to the result.

7. Sum of All Numbers in an Array
Question: Write a function to find the sum of all numbers in an array.
Solution:
const sumArray = (arr) => {
    return arr.reduce((acc, num) => acc + num, 0);
};

// Example usage:
console.log(sumArray([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]));  // Output: 15


Explanation: The reduce() method is used to accumulate the sum of all numbers in the array.

8. Palindrome Check
Question: Write a function to check if a string is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backwards).
Solution:
const isPalindrome = (str) => {
    const cleaned = str.replace(/[^a-zA-Z0-9]/g, '').toLowerCase();
    return cleaned === cleaned.split('').reverse().join('');
};

// Example usage:
console.log(isPalindrome("A man, a plan, a canal, Panama"));  // Output: true


Explanation: This solution first removes all non-alphanumeric characters and converts the string to lowercase. Then it checks if the string is the same forwards and backwards.

9. Merge Two Sorted Arrays
Question: Write a function to merge two sorted arrays into one sorted array.
Solution:
const mergeSortedArrays = (arr1, arr2) => {
    let i = 0, j = 0, result = [];
    
    while (i < arr1.length && j < arr2.length) {
        if (arr1[i] < arr2[j]) {
            result.push(arr1[i]);
            i++;
        } else {
            result.push(arr2[j]);
            j++;
        }
    }

    return result.concat(arr1.slice(i)).concat(arr2.slice(j));
};

// Example usage:
console.log(mergeSortedArrays([1, 3, 5], [2, 4, 6]));  // Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]


Explanation: The function compares elements from both arrays and adds the smaller element to the result array. It then concatenates any remaining elements from the arrays.

10. Find the Length of the Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
Question: Write a function to find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.
Solution:
const longestSubstring = (str) => {
    let seen = new Set();
    let left = 0, maxLength = 0;

    for (let right = 0; right < str.length; right++) {
        while (seen.has(str[right])) {
            seen.delete(str[left]);
            left++;
        }
        seen.add(str[right]);
        maxLength = Math.max(maxLength, right - left + 1);
    }

    return maxLength;
};

// Example usage:
console.log(longestSubstring("abcabcbb"));  // Output: 3


Explanation: The function uses the sliding window technique with two pointers (left and right). It keeps track of characters in a Set and ensures there are no repeating characters in the window.

11. Implement a Basic HTTP Server in Node.js
Question: Write a basic HTTP server in Node.js that responds with "Hello, World!" when accessed.
Solution:
const http = require('http');

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
    res.statusCode = 200;
    res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/plain');
    res.end('Hello, World!\n');
});

server.listen(3000, '127.0.0.1', () => {
    console.log('Server running at http://127.0.0.1:3000/');
});


Explanation: This code creates a simple HTTP server that listens on port 3000 and responds with "Hello, World!" when accessed.

1. Event Loop in Node.js
Question: Can you explain the Event Loop in Node.js and how it works?
Solution:
The Event Loop is a fundamental part of Node.js that allows it to perform non-blocking I/O operations. Node.js is single-threaded, which means it can handle multiple operations concurrently without blocking the main thread. Here’s how it works:

Phase 1: The event loop starts by executing the initial code.

Phase 2: It processes all the asynchronous callbacks that have been queued in the event queue.

Phase 3: The event loop continues to handle I/O operations, allowing Node.js to perform other tasks while waiting for I/O tasks to complete.

Node.js handles I/O in a non-blocking way, meaning that operations like reading from a file, querying a database, or making HTTP requests don’t block the execution of the program.

Explanation: The event loop allows for asynchronous and concurrent processing in a single thread by queuing tasks and handling them one at a time when the thread is free.

2. Callback Functions in Node.js
Question: Can you explain what callbacks are and provide an example?
Solution:
A callback is a function passed as an argument to another function, which is then executed once the task is completed.
const fs = require('fs');

// Asynchronous read file example
fs.readFile('example.txt', 'utf8', (err, data) => {
    if (err) {
        console.log('Error reading file:', err);
    } else {
        console.log('File content:', data);
    }
});
Explanation: In this example, fs.readFile() takes a callback function that gets executed once the file is read. If an error occurs, it's passed to the callback; otherwise, the data is passed to it.

3. Promises in Node.js
Question: Can you explain what a Promise is in Node.js and how it works?
Solution:
A Promise represents an asynchronous operation that will eventually complete, either resolving with a value or rejecting with an error.

const doSomething = () => {
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        let success = true;
        if (success) {
            resolve("Operation successful!");
        } else {
            reject("Operation failed.");
        }
    });
};

doSomething()
    .then(result => {
        console.log(result);  // Output: Operation successful!
    })
    .catch(error => {
        console.error(error);  // Output: Operation failed.
    });


    Explanation: Promises are used to handle asynchronous operations in a more structured way. .then() handles the successful result, and .catch() handles errors.

4. Async/Await in Node.js
Question: What is async/await in Node.js, and how is it different from using Promises?
Solution:
Async/await is a more modern way of handling asynchronous code in Node.js. async functions always return a Promise, and await is used to pause the execution of the function until the Promise is resolved.

const fetchData = async () => {
    const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
    const data = await response.json();
    return data;
};

fetchData()
    .then(data => console.log(data))
    .catch(error => console.error(error));

Explanation: async makes the function return a Promise, and await pauses the execution until the Promise resolves. This makes asynchronous code easier to write and read compared to using .then() and .catch().

5. Express Middleware
Question: What is middleware in Express.js, and can you write a simple example?
Solution:
Middleware in Express.js is a function that gets executed during the lifecycle of a request to the server. It can modify the request object, the response object, or terminate the request-response cycle.

const express = require('express');
const app = express();

// Custom middleware
const logRequest = (req, res, next) => {
    console.log(`${req.method} ${req.url}`);
    next(); // Pass the control to the next middleware or route
};

app.use(logRequest);

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
    res.send('Hello, World!');
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
    console.log('Server running on port 3000');
});


Explanation: In this example, the logRequest middleware logs the HTTP method and the URL of every incoming request before the request is passed to the route handler.

6. Database Connection (MongoDB)
Question: How would you connect Node.js to a MongoDB database using Mongoose?
Solution:
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

// Connect to MongoDB
mongoose.connect('mongodb://localhost/mydb', { useNewUrlParser: true, useUnifiedTopology: true })
    .then(() => console.log('Connected to MongoDB...'))
    .catch(err => console.error('Could not connect to MongoDB...', err));

// Define a simple schema
const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
    name: String,
    email: String
});

// Create a model from the schema
const User = mongoose.model('User', userSchema);

// Create and save a user
const createUser = async () => {
    const user = new User({
        name: 'John Doe',
        email: 'john@example.com'
    });
    await user.save();
};

createUser();


Explanation: This code connects to a MongoDB database using Mongoose, defines a schema, and creates a new user document in the database.

7. Handling File Uploads with Multer
Question: How would you handle file uploads in an Express application using Multer?
Solution:

const express = require('express');
const multer = require('multer');
const app = express();

// Configure Multer to store uploaded files in a 'uploads' directory
const storage = multer.diskStorage({
    destination: (req, file, cb) => {
        cb(null, 'uploads/');
    },
    filename: (req, file, cb) => {
        cb(null, Date.now() + '-' + file.originalname);
    }
});

const upload = multer({ storage });

// Route to handle file upload
app.post('/upload', upload.single('file'), (req, res) => {
    res.send('File uploaded successfully');
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
    console.log('Server running on port 3000');
});

Explanation: This example demonstrates how to use Multer to handle file uploads. Files are stored in the uploads/ directory, and the filename is appended with a timestamp to avoid name collisions.

8. Rate Limiting in Express.js
Question: How would you implement basic rate limiting for an Express API?
Solution:
You can use the express-rate-limit package to rate-limit requests.
const express = require('express');
const rateLimit = require('express-rate-limit');
const app = express();

// Create a rate limiter
const limiter = rateLimit({
    windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes
    max: 100, // limit each IP to 100 requests per windowMs
    message: 'Too many requests, please try again later.'
});

// Apply the rate limiter to all routes
app.use(limiter);

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
    res.send('Welcome to the API!');
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
    console.log('Server running on port 3000');
});


Explanation: This code limits the number of requests a client can make to 100 requests per 15-minute window. If the limit is exceeded, the user receives a "Too many requests" message.


9. Event Emitters in Node.js
Question: What are Event Emitters in Node.js, and how would you use them?
Solution:

const EventEmitter = require('events');

// Create a new event emitter instance
const myEmitter = new EventEmitter();

// Event listener
myEmitter.on('event', () => {
    console.log('An event has occurred!');
});

// Emit the event
myEmitter.emit('event');

Explanation: The EventEmitter class is used for creating custom event-driven systems. You define events using .on(), and the events are triggered using .emit().

10. Handling Uncaught Exceptions and Unhandled Promise Rejections
Question: How would you handle uncaught exceptions and unhandled promise rejections in Node.js?
Solution:
// Handle uncaught exceptions
process.on('uncaughtException', (err) => {
    console.error('Uncaught Exception:', err);
    process.exit(1); // Exit the process after handling the error
});

// Handle unhandled promise rejections
process.on('unhandledRejection', (err) => {
    console.error('Unhandled Rejection:', err);
    process.exit(1); // Exit the process after handling the error
});


Explanation: In Node.js, uncaughtException and unhandledRejection events are emitted when there is an unhandled error. It's crucial to listen for these events to prevent the application from crashing unexpectedly.

Conclusion
These questions assess your understanding of both theoretical concepts and practical skills needed for Node.js development. To perform well in the interview, focus on demonstrating your knowledge of:

Asynchronous programming (callbacks, promises, async/await)

Express.js and middleware

Database integration (MongoDB with Mongoose)

File handling (using Multer)

Event-driven architecture (using EventEmitter)

Error handling (uncaught exceptions and promise rejections)


1. Cluster Module in Node.js
Question: How can you improve the performance of a Node.js application using the Cluster module?
Solution:
The Cluster module in Node.js allows you to create child processes (workers) that can share the same server port. This is particularly useful in a multi-core system, as Node.js is single-threaded, and the Cluster module helps leverage multiple CPU cores.

const cluster = require('cluster');
const http = require('http');
const os = require('os');

if (cluster.isMaster) {
    // Fork workers for each CPU core
    const numCPUs = os.cpus().length;
    for (let i = 0; i < numCPUs; i++) {
        cluster.fork();
    }

    cluster.on('exit', (worker, code, signal) => {
        console.log(`Worker ${worker.process.pid} died`);
    });
} else {
    http.createServer((req, res) => {
        res.writeHead(200);
        res.end('Hello, Node.js Cluster!');
    }).listen(8000);
}

Explanation: This example uses the Cluster module to create workers, with each worker handling HTTP requests. This approach utilizes all CPU cores and improves the performance of Node.js applications by distributing the workload.

2. Memory Leak Detection
Question: How would you detect and fix memory leaks in a Node.js application?
Solution:
Memory leaks in Node.js applications can be identified by monitoring the memory usage over time. You can use tools like heapdump, node-inspect, or VisualVM to inspect the memory.

Here’s a simple example using process.memoryUsage() to monitor memory consumption:
setInterval(() => {
    const memoryUsage = process.memoryUsage();
    console.log(`Heap Used: ${memoryUsage.heapUsed / 1024 / 1024} MB`);
}, 5000);

// Example function that could cause memory leak
let leakyArray = [];
setInterval(() => {
    leakyArray.push(new Array(1000000).join('a')); // Memory leak example
}, 1000);

Explanation: The process.memoryUsage() method reports memory usage. If memory usage continues to grow without being freed, it could indicate a memory leak. Use a memory profiler like Heapdump to capture and analyze memory snapshots.

3. Caching with Redis in Node.js
Question: How can you implement caching in Node.js using Redis?
Solution:
Redis can be used as an in-memory cache to store frequently accessed data, which helps in reducing the load on the database.

Here’s an example using node-redis to implement caching:
const redis = require('redis');
const client = redis.createClient();

// Function to get data from cache or database
const getData = (key, callback) => {
    client.get(key, (err, result) => {
        if (err) throw err;
        if (result) {
            console.log('Cache hit');
            callback(null, JSON.parse(result));  // Return cached data
        } else {
            console.log('Cache miss');
            // Simulate database fetch
            const dataFromDb = { id: 1, name: 'Node.js' };
            client.setex(key, 3600, JSON.stringify(dataFromDb));  // Cache data for 1 hour
            callback(null, dataFromDb);
        }
    });
};

// Example usage
getData('user:1', (err, data) => {
    if (err) throw err;
    console.log(data);
});

Explanation: This code demonstrates caching data in Redis. When the data is not found in the cache, it is fetched from the database and then stored in Redis for future use. The data is cached for one hour using the setex method.

4. Implementing a Rate Limiter
Question: How would you implement a rate limiter in a Node.js application?
Solution:
A rate limiter can restrict the number of requests a user can make to your application in a given time frame. Here’s an implementation using express-rate-limit:

const express = require('express');
const rateLimit = require('express-rate-limit');
const app = express();

// Set up a basic rate limiter
const limiter = rateLimit({
    windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes
    max: 100, // limit to 100 requests per window
    message: 'Too many requests, please try again later.',
});

app.use(limiter);

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
    res.send('Welcome to the API!');
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
    console.log('Server running on port 3000');
});


Explanation: The express-rate-limit middleware restricts the number of requests each client can make to 100 requests in 15 minutes. If the limit is exceeded, the server responds with a message to the user.


5. File Streaming in Node.js
Question: How do you handle file streaming in Node.js?
Solution:
You can use streams in Node.js to efficiently handle large files without loading the entire file into memory.

Here’s an example of streaming a large file to the client:
const fs = require('fs');
const http = require('http');

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
    const filePath = 'largeFile.txt';  // Path to the file you want to stream
    const readStream = fs.createReadStream(filePath);

    // Pipe the file stream to the response
    res.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'text/plain' });
    readStream.pipe(res);

    readStream.on('error', (err) => {
        res.statusCode = 500;
        res.end('File not found');
    });
});

server.listen(3000, () => {
    console.log('Server running at http://localhost:3000');
});


Explanation: This example demonstrates how to stream large files to the client without loading the entire file into memory. The fs.createReadStream() method returns a stream, and we use the .pipe() method to send the file content directly to the response.

6. Child Processes in Node.js
Question: How can you use child processes to run tasks in parallel in Node.js?
Solution:
Node.js provides a child_process module that allows you to spawn new processes. This is useful for performing CPU-heavy operations in parallel without blocking the event loop.

Here’s an example using the spawn() method to run a command in a child process:

const { spawn } = require('child_process');

const child = spawn('node', ['-e', 'console.log("Hello from child process!")']);

child.stdout.on('data', (data) => {
    console.log(`Child process output: ${data}`);
});

child.on('exit', (code) => {
    console.log(`Child process exited with code ${code}`);
});


Explanation: The spawn() method is used to execute a command in a separate process. The output of the child process is captured using the stdout.on('data') event.

7. Global Error Handling
Question: How do you handle uncaught exceptions and unhandled promise rejections in Node.js?
Solution:
// Handle uncaught exceptions
process.on('uncaughtException', (err) => {
    console.error('Uncaught Exception:', err);
    process.exit(1);  // Exit the process after handling the error
});

// Handle unhandled promise rejections
process.on('unhandledRejection', (err) => {
    console.error('Unhandled Rejection:', err);
    process.exit(1);  // Exit the process after handling the error
});


Explanation: It’s a best practice to listen for uncaughtException and unhandledRejection events. These can help ensure that your application logs the error and gracefully exits to avoid potential memory leaks or undefined states.

8. Debouncing and Throttling in Node.js
Question: What are debouncing and throttling, and how do you implement them in Node.js?
Solution:
Debouncing: Debouncing ensures that a function is not executed repeatedly in rapid succession. It limits the number of calls by waiting for a pause in the event.

const debounce = (func, delay) => {
    let timeout;
    return function (...args) {
        clearTimeout(timeout);
        timeout = setTimeout(() => func(...args), delay);
    };
};

const onSearch = debounce((searchTerm) => {
    console.log('Searching for:', searchTerm);
}, 1000);

// Example usage
onSearch('hello');
onSearch('hello world');

Throttling: Throttling limits the number of times a function can be called in a specific time interval.

const throttle = (func, limit) => {
    let lastCall = 0;
    return function (...args) {
        const now = new Date().getTime();
        if (now - lastCall >= limit) {
            func(...args);
            lastCall = now;
        }
    };
};

const onScroll = throttle(() => {
    console.log('Scroll event triggered');
}, 1000);

// Example usage
onScroll();
onScroll();

Explanation: Debouncing ensures the function is executed only after a certain delay, while throttling ensures the function is executed at most once in a specified period.

9. Error-First Callback Pattern
Question: What is the Error-First Callback pattern in Node.js, and how does it work?
Solution:
In the Error-First Callback pattern, the first argument of the callback function is reserved for the error (if any), and subsequent arguments are used for the result. This is commonly used in asynchronous APIs.

const fs = require('fs');

fs.readFile('file.txt', 'utf8', (err, data) => {
    if (err) {
        console.error('Error:', err);
        return;
    }
    console.log('File content:', data);
});


Explanation: The callback receives an error object as the first parameter. If there is no error, the second parameter is the result of the operation (in this case, the file content).

1. Scenario: Scaling a Node.js Application
Question:
Your team has developed a Node.js application that has been gaining traction, and you’re seeing a significant increase in traffic. However, the app is starting to slow down, especially when multiple requests are made simultaneously. How would you scale this application to handle a larger number of concurrent requests?

Solution:
To handle a significant increase in traffic, we need to consider the following approaches:

Use the Cluster Module for Multi-Core CPU Utilization:

Since Node.js runs on a single thread by default, leveraging multiple cores of the CPU can significantly increase performance. The Cluster module allows you to fork child processes that can handle requests in parallel.

const cluster = require('cluster');
const http = require('http');
const os = require('os');

if (cluster.isMaster) {
    const numCPUs = os.cpus().length;
    for (let i = 0; i < numCPUs; i++) {
        cluster.fork();
    }

    cluster.on('exit', (worker, code, signal) => {
        console.log(`Worker ${worker.process.pid} died`);
    });
} else {
    http.createServer((req, res) => {
        res.writeHead(200);
        res.end('Hello from the Node.js Cluster!');
    }).listen(8000);
}
Use Load Balancers:

In production, you can use a load balancer to distribute requests evenly across multiple Node.js instances (workers). This ensures no single instance gets overwhelmed, and traffic is efficiently distributed.

Optimize Database Calls:

Ensure that database queries are optimized (e.g., using indexes) to handle more traffic without slowing down. Database connection pooling is also useful for scaling the database layer.

Caching:

Use a caching solution like Redis to store frequently accessed data. This reduces the number of requests to your database and helps your application scale horizontally.

const redis = require('redis');
const client = redis.createClient();

client.get('some_key', (err, data) => {
    if (data) {
        // Return cached data
        console.log('Cache hit');
    } else {
        // Query the database, then cache the result
        client.set('some_key', 'some_data', 'EX', 3600);
    }
});

Asynchronous Processing:

Implement queues (e.g., using RabbitMQ or Bull with Redis) for background processing, to offload heavy tasks (like image processing) to separate workers and prevent blocking the main event loop.

2. Scenario: API Rate Limiting
Question:
You are building an API that is publicly accessible, and you want to ensure that no user makes too many requests in a short period (e.g., to prevent abuse). How would you implement rate-limiting for your API?

Solution:
Use a Rate Limiting Middleware:

A popular solution in Node.js is using the express-rate-limit middleware to limit the number of requests a user can make within a given time window (e.g., 100 requests per 15 minutes).

const express = require('express');
const rateLimit = require('express-rate-limit');

const app = express();

const limiter = rateLimit({
    windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes
    max: 100, // Limit each IP to 100 requests per windowMs
    message: 'Too many requests, please try again later.',
});

// Apply the rate limiter to all requests
app.use(limiter);

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
    res.send('Welcome to the API');
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
    console.log('Server running on port 3000');
});

Redis-based Rate Limiting:

For more advanced use cases (e.g., distributed systems), Redis can be used to store the request count per IP. Redis is fast and can be shared between multiple instances of your app to maintain consistent rate limits.

const redis = require('redis');
const client = redis.createClient();
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.use((req, res, next) => {
    const ip = req.ip;
    client.incr(ip, (err, count) => {
        if (count > 100) {
            return res.status(429).send('Too many requests');
        }
        if (count === 1) {
            client.expire(ip, 900); // Set expiry time of 15 minutes
        }
        next();
    });
});

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
    res.send('Welcome to the API');
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
    console.log('Server running on port 3000');
});


3. Scenario: Long-Running Task
Question:
You are developing a service where users upload files. The service performs complex processing on each file (e.g., image resizing or data extraction). This task takes a while to complete. How would you handle long-running tasks in Node.js to avoid blocking the event loop?

Solution:
Use Background Workers (Job Queue):

For long-running tasks like file processing, offload the task to a background worker or use a job queue. This prevents blocking the main event loop, allowing the server to continue processing other requests.

Example using Bull (a popular job queue library):
const { Queue } = require('bull');
const fileQueue = new Queue('file-processing');

// Producer: Add a job to the queue when a file is uploaded
fileQueue.add({ filePath: 'path/to/file.jpg' });

// Consumer: Process the job in a separate worker process
fileQueue.process(async (job) => {
    const { filePath } = job.data;
    await processFile(filePath); // Your complex file processing logic
    return true;
});

async function processFile(filePath) {
    // Simulate complex file processing
    console.log(`Processing file: ${filePath}`);
    return new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 5000)); // Simulate a delay
}


Use Child Processes:

You can also use child processes to run heavy computations in parallel to the main event loop. Node.js allows spawning child processes to offload tasks from the main thread.

const { fork } = require('child_process');

const child = fork('processFile.js'); // Separate file to handle file processing
child.send({ filePath: 'path/to/file.jpg' });

child.on('message', (result) => {
    console.log('File processed:', result);
});


Use Serverless Functions:

If the processing is independent and can be done asynchronously, consider using serverless functions (AWS Lambda, Azure Functions) to handle the task, especially if you need elastic scaling.

4. Scenario: Memory Leak in a Node.js Application
Question:
You’re running a Node.js application, and it has been running fine for a while. However, after some time, you notice that it is consuming more and more memory until it crashes. What would be your approach to identify and fix the memory leak?

Solution:
Use Node.js Process Monitoring:

Use process.memoryUsage() to track memory consumption over time.

setInterval(() => {
    const memoryUsage = process.memoryUsage();
    console.log(`Heap Used: ${memoryUsage.heapUsed / 1024 / 1024} MB`);
}, 5000);

Use the heapdump Module:

You can take a snapshot of the heap memory to analyze memory leaks in detail. The heapdump module allows you to generate a snapshot of the memory heap for further inspection.

const heapdump = require('heapdump');

// Trigger heap snapshot on some event (e.g., a signal)
heapdump.writeSnapshot('/path/to/snapshot.heapsnapshot');
Analyze with Chrome DevTools:

After generating a heap snapshot, you can open the .heapsnapshot file in Chrome DevTools to inspect memory usage, detect objects that are not being freed, and find potential memory leaks.

Common Sources of Memory Leaks:

Global variables and closures that reference large objects and prevent them from being garbage collected.

Event listeners that are not removed, causing objects to remain in memory.

Unclosed database connections or file streams.

Fixing the Leak:

Ensure that you clean up resources like event listeners, file streams, and database connections after they’re no longer needed.

Use weak references if needed (for large data objects that you want to allow garbage collection).

1. Scenario: Handling File Uploads with Large Files
Question:
You are building a Node.js service where users can upload files. Some of these files are quite large (up to several GBs). How would you handle the upload of large files to ensure performance and avoid memory overload?

Solution:
To handle large file uploads efficiently, you should avoid loading the entire file into memory. Here’s how you can do it:

Stream the Files Instead of Loading Them Into Memory:

Use streams to read the file in chunks and write it to disk, which helps to keep memory usage low.
const fs = require('fs');
const path = require('path');
const express = require('express');
const multer = require('multer');
const upload = multer({ dest: 'uploads/' });

const app = express();

app.post('/upload', upload.single('file'), (req, res) => {
    const filePath = path.join(__dirname, 'uploads', req.file.filename);
    const fileStream = fs.createReadStream(filePath);

    fileStream.on('data', (chunk) => {
        console.log(`Received ${chunk.length} bytes of data.`);
    });

    fileStream.on('end', () => {
        res.status(200).send('File uploaded and processed.');
    });

    // Process the file stream without loading it fully into memory
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
    console.log('Server running on port 3000');
});

Use Multipart Uploads for Very Large Files (e.g., AWS S3):

For extremely large files, consider using multipart uploads to upload the file in parts to a cloud storage service like AWS S3, which can handle larger files by splitting them into smaller chunks.

// Example: Using AWS SDK to handle file uploads in parts to S3
const AWS = require('aws-sdk');
const s3 = new AWS.S3();
const fs = require('fs');

const uploadFileToS3 = async (filePath, bucketName) => {
    const fileStream = fs.createReadStream(filePath);
    const params = {
        Bucket: bucketName,
        Key: 'large-file.txt',
        Body: fileStream,
    };
    return s3.upload(params).promise();
};


Limit File Size and Use Proper Validation:

Set size limits for the uploaded files to ensure that users can't upload overly large files that could overwhelm your server.

const multer = require('multer');
const upload = multer({ 
    dest: 'uploads/',
    limits: { fileSize: 50 * 1024 * 1024 }  // Max file size: 50 MB
});

2. Scenario: Building an API with Authentication
Question:
You are building an API for a web application where users need to authenticate using JSON Web Tokens (JWT). How would you implement JWT-based authentication in Node.js using Express?

Solution:
To implement JWT authentication, the flow generally involves:

User Login – User sends login credentials (e.g., username/password), and if valid, the server generates a JWT.

Protect Routes – Use middleware to validate the JWT for protected routes.

Token Expiry and Refresh – Handle token expiration and potentially use refresh tokens.

Installing Dependencies:
npm install express jsonwebtoken bcryptjs

Creating the JWT Token on Login:
const express = require('express');
const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');
const bcrypt = require('bcryptjs');
const app = express();

const users = [{ username: 'user1', password: 'hashedpassword' }]; // Example users

app.use(express.json());

// Login route to authenticate and generate JWT
app.post('/login', async (req, res) => {
    const { username, password } = req.body;
    const user = users.find(u => u.username === username);
    
    if (!user) {
        return res.status(401).json({ message: 'Invalid credentials' });
    }

    const isPasswordValid = await bcrypt.compare(password, user.password);
    if (!isPasswordValid) {
        return res.status(401).json({ message: 'Invalid credentials' });
    }

    const token = jwt.sign({ username: user.username }, 'secretkey', { expiresIn: '1h' });
    res.json({ token });
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
    console.log('Server running on port 3000');
});

Creating Middleware to Validate the Token:

const authenticate = (req, res, next) => {
    const token = req.headers['authorization']?.split(' ')[1]; // Extract the token from the "Authorization" header
    if (!token) {
        return res.status(403).json({ message: 'Access denied' });
    }

    jwt.verify(token, 'secretkey', (err, decoded) => {
        if (err) {
            return res.status(401).json({ message: 'Invalid token' });
        }
        req.user = decoded; // Store user info in the request object
        next();
    });
};

// Protected route
app.get('/protected', authenticate, (req, res) => {
    res.json({ message: 'This is a protected route', user: req.user });
});

Handle Token Expiry and Refresh:

After the JWT expires, you can handle token refreshing with a refresh token.

3. Scenario: Handling Concurrent Requests and Managing Deadlocks
Question:
You are working on a Node.js application that performs some time-consuming tasks (e.g., processing data) and may face deadlocks or blocking issues when multiple requests are processed concurrently. How would you handle concurrency to prevent performance degradation or deadlocks?

Solution:
Avoid Blocking the Event Loop:

Node.js uses a single-threaded event loop, so if you block the event loop with synchronous operations, it can lead to performance bottlenecks.

Always use asynchronous I/O operations and avoid synchronous functions (e.g., fs.readFileSync()).

const fs = require('fs');

// Correct: Use asynchronous file reading
fs.readFile('file.txt', 'utf8', (err, data) => {
    if (err) throw err;
    console.log(data);
});


Queueing Jobs to Handle Concurrent Tasks:

Use a job queue (e.g., Bull, Kue, or Bee Queue) to offload heavy tasks from the main event loop. This allows requests to be processed in parallel by worker processes.

const Queue = require('bull');
const queue = new Queue('job-queue');

// Producer: Add a job to the queue
app.post('/process', (req, res) => {
    queue.add({ taskData: 'some data' });
    res.send('Task is being processed');
});

// Consumer: Process the job
queue.process(async (job) => {
    console.log('Processing job', job.data);
    // Perform the task
});


Implement Timeouts to Prevent Hanging Requests:

Use timeouts to ensure that long-running tasks don’t block the event loop indefinitely. If a task takes too long, it should be canceled or handled separately.

const timeoutPromise = new Promise((_, reject) => setTimeout(() => reject(new Error('Timeout exceeded')), 5000));

Promise.race([performTask(), timeoutPromise])
    .then(result => {
        console.log(result);
    })
    .catch(error => {
        console.error(error);
    });


Use Worker Threads for CPU-bound Tasks:

If you need to run CPU-intensive tasks (like data processing or image manipulation), use worker threads to offload the computation to separate threads and avoid blocking the event loop.

const { Worker, isMainThread, parentPort } = require('worker_threads');

if (isMainThread) {
    const worker = new Worker(__filename); // Running this file as worker
    worker.on('message', (result) => {
        console.log('Received from worker:', result);
    });
    worker.postMessage('start');
} else {
    parentPort.on('message', (message) => {
        if (message === 'start') {
            parentPort.postMessage('Task completed');
        }
    });
}


4. Scenario: Handling Multiple Microservices
Question:
Your application is transitioning into a microservices architecture. How would you handle inter-service communication and service discovery in your Node.js-based microservices system?

Solution:
Inter-Service Communication:

REST APIs: Microservices often communicate using HTTP-based REST APIs. You can use Axios or node-fetch to make HTTP requests between services.

const axios = require('axios');

axios.get('http://service-b/api/data')
    .then(response => {
        console.log(response.data);
    })
    .catch(error => {
        console.error(error);
    });


Service Discovery:

For dynamic service discovery, you can use tools like Consul or Kubernetes. These tools can automatically register services and allow microservices to find each other.

Message Brokers for Decoupling:

For asynchronous communication, consider using message brokers like RabbitMQ, Kafka, or Redis Pub/Sub to decouple services and ensure they don’t need to directly call each other synchronously.

const amqp = require('amqplib');

amqp.connect('amqp://localhost')
    .then((conn) => conn.createChannel())
    .then((channel) => {
        const queue = 'task_queue';
        const msg = 'Hello World';
        channel.assertQueue(queue, { durable: true });
        channel.sendToQueue(queue, Buffer.from(msg), { persistent: true });
        console.log(" [x] Sent '%s'", msg);
    })
    .catch(console.error);


1. Snippet: Memory Leak in Event Listeners
Problem:
You are given the following code snippet. There is a potential memory leak due to unremoved event listeners. Can you identify and fix the problem?
const EventEmitter = require('events');

class MyEmitter extends EventEmitter {}

const myEmitter = new MyEmitter();

function onEvent() {
    console.log('Event occurred!');
}

// Add event listener
myEmitter.on('event', onEvent);

// Simulate some conditions to trigger multiple events
setInterval(() => {
    myEmitter.emit('event');
}, 1000);

Solution:
The problem here is that the event listener is not being removed, leading to a memory leak if the setInterval() continues indefinitely. The listener should be removed after it’s no longer needed.

To fix this, use the off() method to remove the event listener when it's no longer necessary.
const EventEmitter = require('events');

class MyEmitter extends EventEmitter {}

const myEmitter = new MyEmitter();

function onEvent() {
    console.log('Event occurred!');
}

// Add event listener
myEmitter.on('event', onEvent);

// Simulate some conditions to trigger multiple events
const interval = setInterval(() => {
    myEmitter.emit('event');
}, 1000);

// Stop emitting events after 5 seconds and remove the event listener
setTimeout(() => {
    clearInterval(interval);
    myEmitter.off('event', onEvent);  // Remove the listener
    console.log('Stopped event emission and removed listener');
}, 5000);


2. Snippet: Callback Hell
Problem:
The following code contains a nested structure that can cause callback hell. Refactor the code to use Promises or async/await to make it more readable and maintainable.

const fs = require('fs');

fs.readFile('file1.txt', 'utf8', (err, data1) => {
    if (err) throw err;
    fs.readFile('file2.txt', 'utf8', (err, data2) => {
        if (err) throw err;
        fs.readFile('file3.txt', 'utf8', (err, data3) => {
            if (err) throw err;
            console.log(data1, data2, data3);
        });
    });
});

Solution:
To improve this code and avoid callback hell, we can use Promises or async/await for better readability.

Solution 1: Using Promises

const fs = require('fs').promises;

async function readFiles() {
    try {
        const data1 = await fs.readFile('file1.txt', 'utf8');
        const data2 = await fs.readFile('file2.txt', 'utf8');
        const data3 = await fs.readFile('file3.txt', 'utf8');
        console.log(data1, data2, data3);
    } catch (err) {
        console.error(err);
    }
}

readFiles();

Solution 2: Using Promise.all()

If you want to read files concurrently:
const fs = require('fs').promises;

async function readFiles() {
    try {
        const [data1, data2, data3] = await Promise.all([
            fs.readFile('file1.txt', 'utf8'),
            fs.readFile('file2.txt', 'utf8'),
            fs.readFile('file3.txt', 'utf8')
        ]);
        console.log(data1, data2, data3);
    } catch (err) {
        console.error(err);
    }
}

readFiles();


3. Snippet: Asynchronous Logic Issue
Problem:
You are given the following code that is supposed to print the sum of two numbers asynchronously. However, it doesn’t behave as expected. Can you identify and fix the issue?

let sum;

function calculateSum(a, b, callback) {
    setTimeout(() => {
        sum = a + b;
        callback(sum);
    }, 1000);
}

calculateSum(3, 4, (result) => {
    console.log('The sum is:', result);
});

console.log('Sum calculated:', sum);  // This doesn't print the correct value


Solution:
The issue here is that the console.log('Sum calculated:', sum) is executed before the asynchronous setTimeout() function completes. This is because JavaScript runs asynchronously.

To fix this, you need to ensure that you are working with the result after the callback has been executed.

Solution:
let sum;

function calculateSum(a, b, callback) {
    setTimeout(() => {
        sum = a + b;
        callback(sum);
    }, 1000);
}

calculateSum(3, 4, (result) => {
    console.log('The sum is:', result);
    console.log('Sum calculated:', sum);  // This will now log after calculation
});

Alternatively, you could use async/await to avoid this kind of situation.

Solution with async/await:
async function calculateSumAsync(a, b) {
    return new Promise((resolve) => {
        setTimeout(() => {
            resolve(a + b);
        }, 1000);
    });
}

async function main() {
    const sum = await calculateSumAsync(3, 4);
    console.log('The sum is:', sum);
}

main();

4. Snippet: Unhandled Rejections
Problem:
The following code snippet might throw an unhandled promise rejection. How can you improve it?

function getUserData(userId) {
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        if (!userId) {
            reject('User ID is required');
        } else {
            resolve({ userId, name: 'John Doe' });
        }
    });
}

getUserData()
    .then((user) => {
        console.log(user);
    });


Solution:
The code above may result in an unhandled promise rejection because the .catch() handler is missing. It’s important to handle promise rejections properly, especially with asynchronous code.

Solution:
function getUserData(userId) {
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        if (!userId) {
            reject('User ID is required');
        } else {
            resolve({ userId, name: 'John Doe' });
        }
    });
}

getUserData()
    .then((user) => {
        console.log(user);
    })
    .catch((err) => {
        console.error('Error:', err);  // Handle the rejection
    });

Alternatively, using async/await:

async function getUserDataAsync(userId) {
    if (!userId) {
        throw new Error('User ID is required');
    }
    return { userId, name: 'John Doe' };
}

async function main() {
    try {
        const user = await getUserDataAsync();
        console.log(user);
    } catch (err) {
        console.error('Error:', err);
    }
}

main();


5. Snippet: Infinite Loop in setInterval
Problem:
You are given the following code snippet, and it has an issue with an infinite loop that should terminate after a certain condition. Identify the issue and fix it.

let counter = 0;

const interval = setInterval(() => {
    console.log('Counter:', counter);
    counter++;

    // The loop never stops
    if (counter === 10) {
        // Issue: condition not met for clearing interval
    }
}, 1000);


Solution:
The issue here is that the condition for clearing the interval is not correctly implemented. You need to clear the interval using clearInterval() once the counter reaches the desired limit.

Solution:

let counter = 0;

const interval = setInterval(() => {
    console.log('Counter:', counter);
    counter++;

    if (counter === 10) {
        clearInterval(interval); // Stop the interval after 10 iterations
        console.log('Interval cleared');
    }
}, 1000);


6. Snippet: Incorrect Use of this Inside Callback
Problem:
In the following code, this is not referring to the expected object inside the callback. Can you fix it?

class Person {
    constructor(name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    greet() {
        setTimeout(function() {
            console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name}`);
        }, 1000);
    }
}

const person = new Person('John');
person.greet();  // This will not print the expected name


Solution:
In JavaScript, the value of this inside a function can be different from the value of this outside the function. To fix this issue, you can either use an arrow function (which does not bind its own this and instead inherits this from the surrounding scope) or use bind().

Solution 1: Using Arrow Function

class Person {
    constructor(name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    greet() {
        setTimeout(() => {
            console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name}`);
        }, 1000);
    }
}

const person = new Person('John');
person.greet();  // This will print the expected name: "Hello, my name is John"

Solution 2: Using bind()
class Person {
    constructor(name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    greet() {
        setTimeout(function() {
            console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name}`);
        }.bind(this), 1000);  // Bind `this` to the correct context
    }
}

const person = new Person('John');
person.greet();  // This will print the expected name: "Hello, my name is John"


7. Snippet: Callback Issues with setTimeout
Problem:
You have a piece of code that uses setTimeout for multiple asynchronous operations. The problem is that setTimeout is behaving unexpectedly with its callbacks. Can you identify and fix the issue?

function processData(data, callback) {
    setTimeout(() => {
        callback(data);
    }, 1000);
}

let data = 5;

processData(data, (result) => {
    console.log(result);
});

data = 10;  // Problem: The data is updated, but the callback still uses the old value

Solution:
The issue here is that the variable data is updated after it’s passed into processData, but because setTimeout uses closures, it holds a reference to the original data at the time it was defined, not the updated one.

Fix: Ensure that you pass the value you want to use at the time of the function call.

function processData(data, callback) {
    setTimeout(() => {
        callback(data);
    }, 1000);
}

let data = 5;

processData(data, (result) => {
    console.log(result);  // Output will be 5, as expected
});

data = 10;  // This update happens after the callback is already set

Alternatively: To ensure the callback always gets the most updated value, pass the value to the function as a parameter directly:

function processData(callback) {
    let data = 5;
    setTimeout(() => {
        callback(data);  // Always gets the current value of data
    }, 1000);
}

processData((result) => {
    console.log(result);  // Output will be 5
});


8. Snippet: Unnecessary Re-renders in React (React Specific)
Problem:
You have a React component that is re-rendering unnecessarily when the state is updated. Identify the issue and fix it.
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function Counter() {
    const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

    // This causes unnecessary re-renders
    const increment = () => {
        setCount(count + 1);  // This is fine, but may cause unnecessary re-renders
    };

    return (
        <div>
            <h1>{count}</h1>
            <button onClick={increment}>Increment</button>
        </div>
    );
}


Solution:
The issue here is that the increment function always references the count value from when the component was last rendered, which can sometimes cause unnecessary re-renders. To fix this, you should use the functional form of setCount that takes the previous state as an argument.

Fixed Code:

import React, { useState } from 'react';

function Counter() {
    const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

    const increment = () => {
        setCount(prevCount => prevCount + 1);  // This ensures no unnecessary re-renders
    };

    return (
        <div>
            <h1>{count}</h1>
            <button onClick={increment}>Increment</button>
        </div>
    );
}


This ensures that the setCount function always updates based on the most recent state value, rather than potentially causing a race condition where the state is not updated correctly.

9. Snippet: Incorrect Data Mutation
Problem:
You are working with arrays and objects in JavaScript. The code below has a bug related to mutation of objects or arrays. Can you fix it?

let users = [
    { name: 'Alice', age: 25 },
    { name: 'Bob', age: 30 }
];

function updateAge(users, name, newAge) {
    users.forEach(user => {
        if (user.name === name) {
            user.age = newAge;  // Problem: Direct mutation of the array
        }
    });
}

updateAge(users, 'Alice', 26);
console.log(users);  // ['Alice', 26] and ['Bob', 30] - direct mutation


Solution:
Direct mutation of arrays or objects can lead to unexpected behavior, especially when working with state in libraries like React. To avoid this, return a new array with the updated values instead of modifying the original array.

Fixed Code:

let users = [
    { name: 'Alice', age: 25 },
    { name: 'Bob', age: 30 }
];

function updateAge(users, name, newAge) {
    return users.map(user => {
        if (user.name === name) {
            return { ...user, age: newAge };  // Return a new object to avoid mutation
        }
        return user;
    });
}

users = updateAge(users, 'Alice', 26);
console.log(users);  // [{ name: 'Alice', age: 26 }, { name: 'Bob', age: 30 }]


By using map() and spread operator, we ensure that the original array remains unchanged and we return a new array with the updated user object.

10. Snippet: Asynchronous Error Handling
Problem:
The following code is supposed to read a file asynchronously, but it’s not handling errors correctly. Can you identify and fix the issue?

const fs = require('fs');

function readFileAsync(filename) {
    fs.readFile(filename, 'utf8', (err, data) => {
        if (err) throw err;  // Not handling errors properly
        console.log(data);
    });
}

readFileAsync('nonexistentFile.txt');


Solution:
Throwing errors inside a callback function can cause uncaught exceptions in the application. It’s better to handle errors more gracefully by logging them or returning them through a callback or promise.

Fixed Code:

const fs = require('fs');

function readFileAsync(filename) {
    fs.readFile(filename, 'utf8', (err, data) => {
        if (err) {
            console.error('Error reading file:', err.message);  // Handle error gracefully
            return;
        }
        console.log(data);
    });
}

readFileAsync('nonexistentFile.txt');


Alternatively, if you want to use async/await to handle errors more easily:

const fs = require('fs').promises;

async function readFileAsync(filename) {
    try {
        const data = await fs.readFile(filename, 'utf8');
        console.log(data);
    } catch (err) {
        console.error('Error reading file:', err.message);  // Gracefully handle errors
    }
}

readFileAsync('nonexistentFile.txt');
This ensures that you are handling errors in a controlled way, avoiding potential crashes.

11. Snippet: Issue with this in setInterval
Problem:
In the following code, this is not behaving as expected inside a setInterval callback. Can you fix it?

class Timer {
    constructor() {
        this.time = 0;
    }

    start() {
        setInterval(function() {
            this.time++;  // Issue: 'this' doesn't refer to the Timer instance
            console.log(this.time);
        }, 1000);
    }
}

const timer = new Timer();
timer.start();

Solution:
The issue arises because inside the setInterval callback, this refers to the global object (or undefined in strict mode) rather than the instance of the Timer class. You can fix this issue using an arrow function or bind() to ensure this is properly bound to the Timer instance.

Fixed Code using Arrow Function:

class Timer {
    constructor() {
        this.time = 0;
    }

    start() {
        setInterval(() => {  // Arrow function binds `this` to the Timer instance
            this.time++;
            console.log(this.time);
        }, 1000);
    }
}

const timer = new Timer();
timer.start();


Fixed Code using bind():

class Timer {
    constructor() {
        this.time = 0;
    }

    start() {
        setInterval(function() {
            this.time++;
            console.log(this.time);
        }.bind(this), 1000);  // Bind `this` to the Timer instance
    }
}

const timer = new Timer();
timer.start();


12. Snippet: Infinite Recursion
Problem:
The following code creates an infinite recursion. Identify the problem and fix it.

function recursiveCall() {
    console.log('Calling function...');
    recursiveCall();  // Problem: The function calls itself endlessly
}

recursiveCall();


Solution:
The issue is that the function calls itself indefinitely. You can fix this by adding a base case that stops the recursion.

Fixed Code:
let counter = 0;

function recursiveCall() {
    if (counter === 5) {  // Base case to stop the recursion
        console.log('Stopping recursion');
        return;
    }
    
    console.log('Calling function...');
    counter++;
    recursiveCall();  // Recursive call
}

recursiveCall();


The base case ensures that the recursion stops once the condition is met.

1. Array Manipulation Problems
Example Question:
Reverse an Array in JavaScript.
function reverseArray(arr) {
    // Write your solution here
}
Solution:
function reverseArray(arr) {
    let left = 0;
    let right = arr.length - 1;
    
    while (left < right) {
        // Swap the elements
        [arr[left], arr[right]] = [arr[right], arr[left]];
        left++;
        right--;
    }
    return arr;
}

console.log(reverseArray([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]));  // [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]


Explanation:
This problem tests your knowledge of array manipulation. The two-pointer technique is used to swap elements from both ends of the array until the pointers meet in the middle.

2. String Manipulation Problems
Example Question:
Check if a string is a palindrome.

function isPalindrome(str) {
    // Write your solution here
}
Solutions:
function isPalindrome(str) {
    const cleaned = str.toLowerCase().replace(/[^a-z0-9]/g, '');  // Remove non-alphanumeric characters
    const reversed = cleaned.split('').reverse().join('');
    return cleaned === reversed;
}

console.log(isPalindrome('A man, a plan, a canal, Panama'));  // true
console.log(isPalindrome('Hello'));  // false
Explanation:
This question checks your ability to manipulate strings. The solution uses regular expressions to remove non-alphanumeric characters and then compares the string to its reverse.

3. Sorting and Searching Problems
Example Question:
Implement Binary Search on a sorted array.
function binarySearch(arr, target) {
    // Write your solution here
}

Solution:
function binarySearch(arr, target) {
    let left = 0;
    let right = arr.length - 1;
    
    while (left <= right) {
        let mid = Math.floor((left + right) / 2);
        
        if (arr[mid] === target) {
            return mid;  // Target found at index mid
        } else if (arr[mid] < target) {
            left = mid + 1;  // Target is on the right half
        } else {
            right = mid - 1;  // Target is on the left half
        }
    }
    return -1;  // Target not found
}

console.log(binarySearch([1, 3, 5, 7, 9], 5));  // 2
console.log(binarySearch([1, 3, 5, 7, 9], 4));  // -1


Explanation:
This problem tests your understanding of the binary search algorithm. It efficiently narrows down the search space by halving it on each iteration.

4. Linked List Problems
Example Question:
Reverse a Linked List.
function reverseLinkedList(head) {
    // Write your solution here
}

Solution:
function reverseLinkedList(head) {
    let prev = null;
    let current = head;
    
    while (current !== null) {
        const next = current.next;
        current.next = prev;
        prev = current;
        current = next;
    }
    
    return prev;
}

// Helper code to create a linked list
function createNode(value) {
    return { value, next: null };
}

const head = createNode(1);
head.next = createNode(2);
head.next.next = createNode(3);

let reversed = reverseLinkedList(head);
while (reversed) {
    console.log(reversed.value);  // 3, 2, 1
    reversed = reversed.next;
}

Explanation:
This problem tests your understanding of linked lists. The solution uses an iterative approach to reverse the pointers of the nodes in the list.

5. Dynamic Programming Problem
Example Question:
Find the Fibonacci Number using dynamic programming.
function fibonacci(n) {
    // Write your solution here
}

Solution:

function fibonacci(n) {
    const dp = [0, 1];  // Base cases: Fibonacci(0) = 0, Fibonacci(1) = 1
    
    for (let i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
        dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2];  // Dynamic programming relation
    }
    
    return dp[n];
}

console.log(fibonacci(5));  // 5
console.log(fibonacci(10));  // 55


Explanation:
This problem tests your ability to solve problems using dynamic programming. By storing the results of previous Fibonacci numbers in an array, you avoid redundant calculations and improve performance.

6. Recursion Problems
Example Question:
Find the factorial of a number using recursion.

function factorial(n) {
    // Write your solution here
}

Solution:
function factorial(n) {
    if (n <= 1) {
        return 1;
    }
    return n * factorial(n - 1);
}

console.log(factorial(5));  // 120
console.log(factorial(3));  // 6
Explanation:
This problem tests your understanding of recursion. The factorial of a number n is calculated as n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) * ... * 1, and it uses a recursive approach.

7. Algorithmic Problems:
Example Question:
Find the missing number in an array that contains numbers from 1 to n with one number missing.

function findMissingNumber(arr, n) {
    // Write your solution here
}
Solution:
function findMissingNumber(arr, n) {
    const totalSum = (n * (n + 1)) / 2;  // Sum of numbers from 1 to n
    const arrSum = arr.reduce((sum, num) => sum + num, 0);
    return totalSum - arrSum;
}

console.log(findMissingNumber([1, 2, 4, 5, 6], 6));  // 3

Explanation:
This problem tests your understanding of mathematics and algorithms. By calculating the sum of the first n natural numbers and subtracting the sum of the elements in the array, you can easily find the missing number.

8. Concurrency Problems
Example Question:
Implement a simple asynchronous function that waits for 1 second before printing a message.

function delayPrint() {
    // Write your solution here
}
Solution:
function delayPrint() {
    return new Promise((resolve) => {
        setTimeout(() => {
            console.log("Message after 1 second");
            resolve();
        }, 1000);
    });
}

delayPrint();

Explanation:
This problem tests your understanding of asynchronous programming. The solution uses setTimeout wrapped in a Promise to wait for 1 second before printing the message.

9. Graph Problems
Example Question:
Find the shortest path in a graph using Breadth-First Search (BFS).
function shortestPath(graph, start, target) {
    // Write your solution here
}
Solution:
function shortestPath(graph, start, target) {
    const queue = [start];
    const visited = new Set();
    const distance = { [start]: 0 };
    
    while (queue.length > 0) {
        const node = queue.shift();
        
        if (node === target) {
            return distance[node];  // Return the shortest distance
        }
        
        visited.add(node);
        
        for (const neighbor of graph[node]) {
            if (!visited.has(neighbor)) {
                visited.add(neighbor);
                queue.push(neighbor);
                distance[neighbor] = distance[node] + 1;
            }
        }
    }
    
    return -1;  // Return -1 if no path exists
}

const graph = {
    A: ['B', 'C'],
    B: ['A', 'D'],
    C: ['A', 'D'],
    D: ['B', 'C'],
};

console.log(shortestPath(graph, 'A', 'D'));  // 2


Explanation:
This problem tests your knowledge of graph traversal using BFS. The algorithm finds the shortest path in an unweighted graph.

1. Event Loop in Node.js
Question:
Explain the event loop in Node.js. How does Node.js handle asynchronous I/O operations?

Answer:
In Node.js, the event loop is the mechanism that handles asynchronous operations. Since Node.js is single-threaded, it uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, which allows it to handle many operations concurrently.

Here's how it works:

Call Stack: Node.js maintains a call stack for function execution.

Event Queue: Asynchronous operations (like setTimeout, database queries, etc.) are sent to the event queue.

Event Loop: The event loop is responsible for checking the call stack and event queue. If the call stack is empty, it picks up callbacks from the event queue and executes them.

Phases: The event loop works in multiple phases like timers, I/O callbacks, idle, poll, check, and close callbacks.

The process of handling async I/O:

When a non-blocking I/O operation is initiated, Node.js delegates the operation to the libuv library (the underlying asynchronous I/O library).

Once the I/O operation completes, the result is placed in the event queue.

The event loop picks up the result and calls the appropriate callback function.

2. Callback Hell
Question:
What is "Callback Hell" in Node.js, and how can you avoid it?

Answer:
"Callback Hell" (or "Pyramid of Doom") occurs when there are multiple nested callbacks, making the code harder to read and maintain.

Example of Callback Hell:
fs.readFile('file1.txt', 'utf8', (err, data1) => {
    if (err) {
        console.log(err);
    } else {
        fs.readFile('file2.txt', 'utf8', (err, data2) => {
            if (err) {
                console.log(err);
            } else {
                fs.readFile('file3.txt', 'utf8', (err, data3) => {
                    if (err) {
                        console.log(err);
                    } else {
                        console.log(data1, data2, data3);
                    }
                });
            }
        });
    }
});


Solutions to Avoid Callback Hell:

Promises: Use Promises to handle asynchronous operations in a more manageable way.

const fs = require('fs').promises;

async function readFiles() {
    try {
        const data1 = await fs.readFile('file1.txt', 'utf8');
        const data2 = await fs.readFile('file2.txt', 'utf8');
        const data3 = await fs.readFile('file3.txt', 'utf8');
        console.log(data1, data2, data3);
    } catch (err) {
        console.log(err);
    }
}

readFiles();

Async/Await: Using async and await makes asynchronous code look and behave more like synchronous code.

3. Promise vs Callback
Question:
What’s the difference between callbacks and promises in Node.js?

Answer:
Callbacks: A callback is a function passed into another function that gets executed once the asynchronous operation completes. However, callbacks can lead to callback hell (nested callbacks).

Promises: Promises are objects that represent the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation. Promises allow chaining .then() for success and .catch() for errors, making the code more readable.

Example with Callbacks:
function fetchData(callback) {
    setTimeout(() => {
        callback('Data received');
    }, 1000);
}
fetchData((data) => {
    console.log(data);
});

Example with Promises:
function fetchData() {
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        setTimeout(() => {
            resolve('Data received');
        }, 1000);
    });
}
fetchData().then((data) => {
    console.log(data);
});


4. Buffer in Node.js
Question:
What is a Buffer in Node.js? How is it used?

Answer:
A Buffer is a global object in Node.js that provides a way of handling binary data directly in memory. It is especially useful when working with I/O operations, such as reading from files, interacting with streams, and handling raw binary data.

Creating a Buffer:

// Create a buffer of 10 bytes
const buffer = Buffer.alloc(10);

// Create a buffer from a string
const buffer2 = Buffer.from('Hello');

// Create a buffer from an array
const buffer3 = Buffer.from([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]);

console.log(buffer);  // <Buffer 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00>
console.log(buffer2);  // <Buffer 48 65 6c 6c 6f>
console.log(buffer3);  // <Buffer 01 02 03 04 05>

Use Cases of Buffers:

Reading binary files.

Networking (handling raw data in streams).

Working with non-text data (like images, videos, etc.).

5. Middleware in Express.js
Question:
What is middleware in Express.js? How does it work?

Answer:
In Express.js, middleware is a function that has access to the request object (req), response object (res), and the next function in the application’s request-response cycle. Middleware functions can modify the request and response objects, or terminate the request-response cycle. They are used for tasks like logging, authentication, validation, etc.

Example of Middleware:
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

// Custom Middleware
app.use((req, res, next) => {
    console.log(`Request Method: ${req.method}, Request URL: ${req.url}`);
    next();  // Pass control to the next middleware
});

// Sample Route
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
    res.send('Hello, World!');
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
    console.log('Server running on port 3000');
});
Explanation:

app.use() is used to register middleware.

The next() function allows passing control to the next middleware or route handler.

6. Error Handling in Node.js
Question:
How does Node.js handle errors in asynchronous code?

Answer:
In Node.js, errors in asynchronous code are typically handled using callbacks, Promises, or async/await. The standard way of handling errors in callbacks is by passing an error object as the first argument to the callback. In Promises, errors are handled by chaining .catch().

Example of Callback Error Handling:

fs.readFile('nonexistentFile.txt', 'utf8', (err, data) => {
    if (err) {
        console.log('Error:', err);
    } else {
        console.log(data);
    }
});


Example of Promise Error Handling:

fs.promises.readFile('nonexistentFile.txt', 'utf8')
    .then((data) => {
        console.log(data);
    })
    .catch((err) => {
        console.log('Error:', err);
    });


    Example of async/await Error Handling:

    async function readFile() {
    try {
        const data = await fs.promises.readFile('nonexistentFile.txt', 'utf8');
        console.log(data);
    } catch (err) {
        console.log('Error:', err);
    }
}

readFile();


7. Cluster Module in Node.js
Question:
What is the cluster module in Node.js, and why is it useful?

Answer:
The cluster module in Node.js is used to create child processes that share the same server port. It is especially useful for utilizing multiple CPU cores to improve the scalability and performance of Node.js applications.

Example of Using Cluster:

const cluster = require('cluster');
const http = require('http');
const numCPUs = require('os').cpus().length;

if (cluster.isMaster) {
    // Fork workers
    for (let i = 0; i < numCPUs; i++) {
        cluster.fork();
    }

    cluster.on('exit', (worker, code, signal) => {
        console.log(`Worker ${worker.process.pid} died`);
    });
} else {
    // Worker processes have a HTTP server
    http.createServer((req, res) => {
        res.writeHead(200);
        res.end('Hello, world!');
    }).listen(8000);
}


Explanation:

The master process forks workers, each handling incoming HTTP requests.

This way, multiple CPU cores are utilized, improving performance for I/O-bound tasks.

8. Memory Leaks in Node.js
Question:
How can you detect and fix memory leaks in Node.js?

Answer:
Memory leaks occur when memory that is no longer in use is not freed, causing the application to consume excessive memory over time. In Node.js, you can detect memory leaks using tools like Chrome DevTools, heap snapshots, and process.memoryUsage().

Common causes of memory leaks in Node.js:

Global variables: Accidental creation of global variables that aren’t properly cleaned up.

Event listeners: Adding event listeners but not removing them when no longer needed.

Closures: Holding references to large objects unintentionally inside closures.

Example of using process.memoryUsage() to detect leaks:

console.log(process.memoryUsage());

Problem 1: Asynchronous File Reading (File I/O)
Question:
"Write a function that reads two text files (file1.txt and file2.txt) asynchronously, and then merges their content and logs it to the console. If there's an error reading any file, handle it gracefully."

Solution Walkthrough:
The candidate needs to use fs.readFile or fs.promises.readFile to read the files asynchronously, and should handle both success and failure cases. Ideally, they will use Promises or async/await to handle the async nature of the task.

const fs = require('fs').promises;

async function readFilesAndMerge() {
    try {
        const file1Content = await fs.readFile('file1.txt', 'utf8');
        const file2Content = await fs.readFile('file2.txt', 'utf8');
        console.log(file1Content + '\n' + file2Content);
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error reading files:', error);
    }
}

readFilesAndMerge();

Node.js Technical Questions and Solutions
1. Event Loop and Asynchronous Programming
Q1: Explain the event loop in Node.js.

Answer:

Node.js is single-threaded and uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model. It handles multiple operations concurrently using the event loop.

The event loop is responsible for managing all asynchronous callbacks. It checks if the call stack is empty, and if it is, it pulls tasks from the event queue and processes them.

The event loop has several phases (Timers, I/O Callbacks, Poll, Check, Close callbacks).

Q2: How does asynchronous I/O work in Node.js?

Answer:

Node.js uses non-blocking I/O. When you call an asynchronous function (e.g., fs.readFile()), Node.js will continue executing the rest of the code and handle the I/O operation in the background.

Once the I/O operation completes, Node.js places the callback into the event queue, which is picked up by the event loop.

2. Promises and Async/Await
Q1: What are Promises in Node.js?

Answer:

A Promise is an object that represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value.

Promises have three states:

Pending: The operation is still in progress.

Resolved: The operation has completed successfully.

Rejected: The operation has failed.

Example:

const fs = require('fs').promises;

fs.readFile('file.txt', 'utf8')
  .then(data => {
    console.log(data);
  })
  .catch(err => {
    console.error(err);
  });


  Q2: What is the difference between callbacks and Promises?

Answer:

Callbacks: Functions passed as arguments to other functions, executed after an operation completes. Callback hell occurs when you have deeply nested callbacks.

Promises: Provide a cleaner way to handle asynchronous operations by chaining .then() for success and .catch() for error handling, avoiding callback hell.

3. HTTP and Express.js
Q1: What is middleware in Express.js?

Answer:

Middleware is a function that has access to the request and response objects in the request-response cycle.

It can modify the request, perform tasks, and end the request-response cycle or pass control to the next middleware in the stack.

Example:
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

// Middleware to log request details
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  console.log(`${req.method} ${req.url}`);
  next();  // Pass control to the next middleware
});

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello, World!');
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server running on port 3000');
});


4. Error Handling
Q1: How do you handle errors in Node.js?

Answer:

In asynchronous code, errors are usually handled using error-first callbacks, Promises, or try/catch in async/await.

Error-first callback: The first argument is always an error (if any), and the second argument is the result.

Example:

fs.readFile('file.txt', 'utf8', (err, data) => {
  if (err) {
    console.error('Error reading file:', err);
  } else {
    console.log('File data:', data);
  }
});


5. Streams
Q1: Explain Streams in Node.js.

Answer:

Streams are objects that allow you to read data from a source or write data to a destination in a continuous manner.

There are four types of streams in Node.js:

Readable streams (e.g., fs.createReadStream())

Writable streams (e.g., fs.createWriteStream())

Duplex streams (both readable and writable)

Transform streams (a type of duplex stream that can modify the data)

Q2: How do you pipe a stream in Node.js?

Answer:

You can use the pipe() method to send the output of one stream directly to another.

Example:

const fs = require('fs');

const readStream = fs.createReadStream('source.txt');
const writeStream = fs.createWriteStream('destination.txt');

// Pipe the data from the read stream to the write stream
readStream.pipe(writeStream);


6. Database Operations
Q1: How do you connect to a MongoDB database using Mongoose in Node.js?

Answer:

Use the Mongoose library to interact with MongoDB databases, providing a higher-level abstraction for database operations.

Example:
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

mongoose.connect('mongodb://localhost/mydb', { useNewUrlParser: true, useUnifiedTopology: true })
  .then(() => console.log('Connected to MongoDB'))
  .catch(err => console.error('Could not connect to MongoDB:', err));


  7. Authentication and Security
Q1: How would you implement JWT authentication in Node.js?

Answer:

Use JWT (JSON Web Token) for stateless authentication.

You would issue a token upon successful login and require that token in the headers of subsequent requests to authenticate users.

Example (Server-side):

const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');
const secret = 'mysecretkey';

// Generate JWT token
const token = jwt.sign({ userId: '123' }, secret, { expiresIn: '1h' });

// Verify JWT token
jwt.verify(token, secret, (err, decoded) => {
  if (err) {
    console.error('Invalid token');
  } else {
    console.log('Decoded token:', decoded);
  }
});

8. Performance and Clustering
Q1: How would you improve the performance of a Node.js application?

Answer:

Use clustering to take advantage of multi-core systems.

Optimize I/O-bound operations using caching (Redis) and CDNs.

Profile and debug the application to identify memory leaks using tools like clinic.js or Chrome DevTools.

Use async/await for better concurrency.
